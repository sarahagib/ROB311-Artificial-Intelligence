# ROB311-Artificial-Intelligence

This repository contains all the projects from ROB311 Artifical Intelligence course. Each assignment file and starter code were provided by the course and I wrote my script within the functions provided. 

## Project 1: State Space Search 
I complete both problems in this assignment. 

My files are: a_star_search.py, bidirectional_search.py, and breadth_first_search.py. 

## Project 2: Structured Problem Solving and Planning
I completed 2/3 problems in this assignment.

My files are: inference_method.py, initialize_greedy_n_queens.py, and min_conflicts_n_queens.py 

Provided files: support.py 

## Project 3: Motion Planning and Adversarial Games 
I completed both problems in the assignment. 

My files are: iterated_single_move_games.py and rrt_planning.py 

Provided files: dubins_path_planning.py and rrt_dubins_problem.py 

For this project, it is important to clarify that in iterated_single_move_games.py my code is in the 'play_game' function which plays rock-paper-scissors with the already provided agents and my own agent in the 'StudentAgent' class. 

## Project 4: Reinforcement Learning 
I completed 2/3 problems in this assignment. 

My files are: part1_1.py, part1_2.py, part2.py, part3.py (unsolved). 

Provided files: mab_util.py, mdp_agent.py, mdp_cleaning_task.py, mdp_env.py, mdp_grid_task.py, test_part1.py, test_part2.py, test_part3.py.
